# Encryption Technique Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an encryption technique using C++ programming language. 

## Tools & Technologies
- C++
- Cubic mathematical equation
- Rotation algorithm
- Complement algorithm
- Other custom algorithms

## Description
This project employs a unique encryption method based on a cubic mathematical equation along with various algorithms including rotation, complement, and more. By utilizing these techniques, a single plaintext input can generate a vast array of distinct coded messages, potentially numbering into the millions. 

## Usage
To use the encryption technique:
1. Input the plaintext message.
2. Apply the encryption algorithms as desired.
3. Receive the encrypted message as the output.

## Note
This project is for educational purposes and should not be used for critical or sensitive data encryption without proper validation and testing.
